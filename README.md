# trunk-recorder-config
Configuration files for using [trunk-recorder](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder) and more specifically the [docker version](https://hub.docker.com/r/robotastic/trunk-recorder) to monitor the UCA radio system.

Forked from [cleeb](https://github.com/cschmittiey/usu-dsd-config/) with love.
